Spark can be used at all the layers
1 Source Layer for data extraction to Raw Layer
2 To generate silver data(clinsed data) in the staging layer/curated layer from the data available in the raw layer
3 To generate gold data(transformed data/production data) in the EDH layer from the data available in staging layer
4 To perform analysis on the EDH Layer
5 To send the analayed output to Visualization tools, ML or other reporting tools
